                    My name is Grimicron. I am an experienced programmer who specializes in utilities and games, but I really just love
                    A.I. I also make pixel-art and retro SFX to complement my game development and as a hobby. I started coding when my father introduced
                    Scratch to me. I loved it, and I was making complex games not long after with it. Later on, I got interested in web development, and
                    I made a really basic website called FrikiWeb. The website was about retro games and some of my comics. I also made some websites for 
                    school projects to get some extra marks, but I always insisted on working with jQuery and vanilla CSS, which really held me back. After 
                    getting bored of web development, I got into Unity game development and made a basic platformer called Fox Jump. Now, I code basically 
                    anything in any language (that is not Java)! Currently, I am learning Bash and nerual nets.

                <p class="text-white body">When I started out on the internet, I chose the name
                <strong> KittyLover321 </strong>
                laughing to myself as I thought: "That's the most internet-y name ever, that's so funny!". The only time I used the alias was
                on Gamejolt for for a short period of time. Later on, I fell in love with the game "Hollow Knight" (you should check it out 
                if you like Metroidvanias). I changed my alias and avatar to the character
                <strong> Grimm </strong>
                from the game. I made some programs and joined some communities under that alias, but again not much. Then, when I 
                started my YouTube channel, I realized the name Grimm was taken many times over, as well as my second options, Grimicorn.
                As such, I simply switched the O and R to get
                <strong> Grimicron! </strong>
                When I made games in Unity and mods in Minecraft, I also used
                <strong> Molten Lava Studios (MLS)</strong>,
                so if you see that name somewhere, that's also me!

                To make, host and share my projects I use Replit. I am using to even host this website! I use it for multiple reason. 
                First off, I adamantly support their mission to level the playing field when it comes to software development, bringing an entire 
                IDE, VM and frameworks to the web in a lightweight way, enabling everyone with a device to code. Second, it is really convenient 
                to create projects in it, since you have thousands of templates to choose from in Replit which come pre-configured, and with its 
                Nix infrastructure, you can install basically anything to your project. Lastly, each project has a professional IDE, version control, 
                debugger, database and package manager. As a bonus, each project is really easy to share, as you can just send the project link. If I managed 
                to interest you in Replit, check it out 
                <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

                countless webpages from scratch with it as well as web servers with Node.js and games with P5.js or also from scratch.
                I have even built evolutionary neural networks from the ground up with it. I have been working with javascript aproximately 
                5 years as of now, and that number will only keep growing. My personal favourite project of mine, 
                <a href="https://replit.com/@Grimicron/Flappy-Neural-Net" target="_blank">Flappy Neural Net</a>, has been built with it.
                I have also coded a text-based

                More importantly, I have extensive experience in game development with the Unity game engine. My projects include shaders, RPGs, 
                platformers, fan-games, 3D shooters and arcade games.  Within the Unity engine, I specialize in 2D games. I have made collaborative 
                projects as well as solo projects. Ando to complement my game making skills I have learnt to make pixel-art and 8-bit sounds.
