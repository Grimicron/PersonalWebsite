                     Hey there!

                <p class="text-white body my-5">When I started out on the internet, I chose the name
                <strong> KittyLover321 </strong>
                laughing to myself as I thought: "That's the most internet-y name ever, that's so funny!". The only time I used the alias was
                on Gamejolt for for a short period of time. Later on, I fell in love with the game "Hollow Knight" (you should check it out 
                if you like Metroidvanias). I changed my alias and avatar to the character
                <strong> Grimm </strong>
                from the game. I made some programs and joined some communities under that alias, but again not much. Then, when I 
                started my YouTube channel, I realized the name Grimm was taken many times over, as well as my second options,
                <strong> Grimicorn.</strong>
                As such, I simply switched the O and R to get Grimicron! When I made games in Unity andmods in Minecraft, I also used
                <strong> Molten Lava Studios (MLS)</strong>, so if you see that name somewhere, that's also me!

                template creation, automizing common calculations like tips or transformations and simple console games like Snake
                or Tetris. Some of the projects that I am most proud of are

                <p class="mx-5 text-secondary body">Javascript is one of the languages that I am most comfortable with, as I have built 
                countless webpages from scratch with it as well as web servers with Node.js and games with P5.js or also from scratch.
                I have even built evolutionary neural networks from the ground up with it. I have been working with javascript aproximately 
                5 years as of now, and that number will only keep growing. My personal favourite project of mine, 
                <a href="https://replit.com/@Grimicron/Flappy-Neural-Net" target="_blank">Flappy Neural Net</a>, has been built with it.
                I have also coded a text-based

                More importantly, I have extensive experience in game development with the Unity game engine. My projects include shaders, RPGs, 
                platformers, fan-games, 3D shooters and arcade games.  Within the Unity engine, I specialize in 2D games. I have made collaborative 
                projects as well as solo projects. Ando to complement my game making skills I have learnt to make pixel-art and 8-bit sounds.
