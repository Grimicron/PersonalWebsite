# Personal Website
My very own website! Check out the website at: https://dev.grimicron.repl.co.

This project is available on Github: https://github.com/Grimicron/PersonalWebsite
And on Replit: https://replit.com/@Grimicron/dev

The Replit project name is a little weird, however, I really wanted the domain to be dev.grimicron.repl.co.

### But hey, the website is there for a reason! See it if you want to know more about me and my projects.
